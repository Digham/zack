The bios initialises the stack pointer to 0xe000, prints a welcome message, and detects and runs programs in the memory.

It also defines a few useful functions (addresses in decimal) - see bios.src for assembly source and more details:

printc  - 107 (char(A))
prints  - 110 (*str(A), len(C))
getc    - 119 () -> char(A)
halt    - 128 ()
clrtty  - 131 ()
clrscr  - 134 ()
showcol - 137 (colnum(C), value(D))
showimg - 145 (*cols(A))

(you can include define.src to use the names of the functions as in the example programs)

Note: prints uses registers A, B, D
      showimg uses registers A and D
      getc overwrites A, B
      showcol overwrites B, C
      The other functions don't overwrite any registers.

Also note: DONT call prints with a length(register C) of ZERO!!!
